This Jupyter notebook contains code and documentation for building a decision tree model to classify tumor samples as malignant or benign based on various features extracted from lab tests. The notebook covers the following key aspects:

Model Training: Training a decision tree classifier using default hyperparameters and evaluating its performance.
Hyperparameter Tuning: Fine-tuning the decision tree model by adjusting hyperparameters using GridSearchCV to optimize performance.
Model Evaluation: Evaluating the tuned model's performance metrics, including accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.
Visualization: Visualizing the trained decision tree to interpret its classification rules and feature importance.
This notebook serves as a practical guide for implementing a decision tree-based classification model for tumor classification, showcasing the process of model development, evaluation, and interpretation.
